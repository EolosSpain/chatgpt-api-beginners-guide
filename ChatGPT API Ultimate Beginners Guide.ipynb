      "User : I know it can be used for machine learning and quick scripts, that's about it\n",
      "Tutor: That's a good start! Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use. It has a vast number of libraries and frameworks which make it versatile and able to be used in a wide range of fields, such as data analytics, web development, scientific computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and more! It is also open source and has a large, active community of users who are willing to share knowledge and help others. \n",

      "User : Some help would be great!\n",
      "Tutor: Sure! Here are the steps to install Python on your computer:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Go to the official Python website: www.python.org\n",
      "2. Click on the \"Downloads\" tab at the top of the page.\n",
      "3. Scroll down until you see \"Python Releases for Windows\" or \"Python Releases for Mac OS X\", depending on your operating system.\n",
      "4. Download the latest version of Python by clicking on the appropriate link.\n",
      "5. Run the installer and follow the instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you have installed Python on your computer, you can open the Python interpreter and start coding. On a Windows machine, you can open the interpreter by clicking \"Python\" in the Start Menu. On a Mac, you can open the Terminal app and type \"python\" to open the interpreter.\n",
